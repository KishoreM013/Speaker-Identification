This Speaker identification was done by using the facebook's Wav2Vec2 model from huggingface and the dataset used for this was taken for Kaggle. The accuracy of this model is just 0.4 so it  needs an improvement to make better classification. The TorchAudio framework was used for this one to load and get detils from it and there was no features extracted for this just the waveform of the audio was given to the processor of wav2vec2 processor.
